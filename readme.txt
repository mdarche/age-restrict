Just another age restriction  plugin. Simple but flexible.

Age Restrict uses a browser cookie to prevent young users from accessing adult website content. It is extremely light weight and flexible. Age Restrict lets you customize the look of the popup and gives you the option to redirect on successful or unsuccessful age validation.
